# Auto-Image-Completion
Tool designers and photographers can use it to fill in unwanted or missing parts of images.

1. Interpreting images as samples from a probability distribution.

2. Quickly generating fake images using Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs).

3. Finding the best fake image for image completion.

## Technology Stack: 
    Python
    TensorFlow
    Pandas
    Numpy

## To-Do
1. Add screenshots of the work.
2. Train the model on actual human photographs.

## Future Scope
Make it auto complete any image(i.e., living as well as non-living)
